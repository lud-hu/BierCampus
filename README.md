# BeerCampus

This is the code of an online serious game about the brewing process of beer. It is possible to learn how different beer types are brewed with an easy drag-and-drop interface and with quiz questions. Furthermore it is possible to play "Connect Four", add other users as friends, write messages to them and look at your personal score.

It is based on Lightbend's Play Framework.

Written in a group of five as a part of a university project at University WÃ¼rzburg, Germany.

Goal of this project was to:
- See what it is like to work as a team on a bigger software project (using tools like git, slack, etc).
- Get introduced to various technologies including the Play! Framework, MySQL, JavaFX, HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
- Connect these technologies to a working Web Application with database communication.
